 @example decode_simple.cpp

 It may be that we want to implement a new decoding algorithm in Kodo or
 simply just test an existing decoding implementation. In that case, it may
 be preferred to reuse functionalities in already existing layers while
 stripping functionalities that are not required to keep it simple.

 This example illustrates how the operations of a RLNC decoder can be
 tested in a binary field without introducing unnecessary complexity.
 To keep it simple, we want to enter the data to be decoded ourself instead
 of relying on an encoder to generate the data.
 The functionalities in layers above the "Codec API" is therefore not
 required and has been stripped from the stack. However, the layers below
 the "Codec API" has been kept as they provide functionalities that are
 required.
